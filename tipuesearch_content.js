Some famous MOOCs companies are Coursera, Udemy, Udacity and edX. There are a plethora of videos on YouTube that teach you every topic conceived under the sun. A learner has unlimited access to resources to gain knowledge. Most of these MOOCs companies allow you to have access to course contents for free and they charge you only when you want a course completion certificate. They ask you to complete a Capstone project which is a project undertaken with rigorous effort to apply the concepts learnt during the duration of the course. Various companies have recognized the values of these MOOCs courses because of the academic rigour involved in earning these certifications. The lockdown period during Corona pandemic crisis has bought the importance of online education forefront. Many universities are encouraging their teachers to impart education through online platforms. Online teaching allows teachers to update their course as and when the technology changes. In Indian context, the government of India under the aegis of the Ministry of Human Resource Development ( MHRD ) , All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) and central government funded institutions like IISC , IITs, IIMs and others premier institutes has started the SWAYAM MOOCs platform. Top quality teaching materials are made available to every person in India irrespective of his state, race, religion, ethnicity, education background thus enabling equality among masses. This idea is revolutionary in the sense that teachers from highly sought premier institutes can now interact with learners throughout the country and their teaching is not restricted to a few students who get admitted to these premier institutions. Learners from rural areas get access to these course contents and they need not lament on the poor teaching conditions in their institutions. Few of the universities in India have recognized these SWAYAM courses and are made as part of their curriculum. Present day Universities should recognize the credits earned through MOOC platforms and they need to enable the smooth transfer of credits from online courses to traditional universities thus facilitating the students to earn their degrees. Many traditional universities in western countries are also offering their courses online that may lead to accredited and recognized degree at fewer cost. These types of accredited online degrees are most sought by the student communities in those countries. Looking at the current situation, the question that arises is whether the online education is making the traditional education irrelevant. Teachers involved in traditional education need to re-invent themselves as change is the only constant thing. With abundant resources available online, students may not be compelled henceforth to take up traditional classes at all. The need of the hour for Teachers is to improve their Pedagogy or the way of teaching. Traditional classroom teaching should stimulate and compel the students to attend their classes. We should make availability of prime quality online videos of traditional teaching. All India Council for Technical Education ( AICTE ) and University Grants Commission ( UGC ) have embarked on funding to enable infrastructure support for teachers to create world class course contents. Teachers must encourage and engage with slow learners and they should not feel like being left behind. A drawback of MOOCs based online teaching is it may lead to boredom among students as they might miss the traditional method of face-to-face interaction. Teachers in traditional teaching setup should come up with assignments that challenge the student's critical thinking. We should give students a choice on how to master their course. We need to make our teaching interesting to students by incorporating novel learning techniques and information and communication technologies ( ICT ) tools. Flipped classroom is one of the most popular ICT teaching method wherein students study at their own pace under the supervision of the teacher. Students are given all the course materials like recorded videos, reading assignments before coming to the class which they need to review. In the class, they are asked to discuss the course materials with their classmates and are expected to learn through this process under the direction of the teacher. Many studies have shown that this approach of blending of both the traditional teaching and online teaching has benefited students and has increased their performance. Teachers in universities should tailor their course to make students industry ready. Recruiters prefer people who have earned their online certifications along with their degrees. Gone are the days when a traditional degree itself would have landed a posh job in a company. Teachers should comprehend that they have to pursue lifelong learning in their quest for excellence and have to update their courses regularly to meet the Industry standards. Stale course contents are a big put-off for students when they have access to newer information elsewhere. Until now, higher education in the country did not have competition, but disruption is being felt across the education sector because of online teaching. Most of the teachers are still in denial about the influence of online teaching on student community and are resistant to adopt innovative teaching methods to challenge the impact of online teaching. Teachers in traditional institutions need to realise that online teaching is here to stay and if they are not proficient enough to compete with online teaching mode, then they are bound to perish.","tags":"Article","url":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/is-online-education-rending-the-traditional-education-obsolete.html","loc":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/is-online-education-rending-the-traditional-education-obsolete.html"},{"title":"Webinar on Topological Data Analysis","text":"Department of CSE , Dr.Ambedkar Institute of Technology, Bengaluru proudly brings to you a Webinar on \"Topological Data Analysis\".

(Dept. of CSE , Dr. AIT ) and Prof. Pushpaveni H (Dept. of CSE , Dr. AIT ), were assigned with the task to come up with a process for writing the Course Outcomes (COs) for a course and the mapping of the Course Outcomes with Program Outcomes (POs) for Course Articulation Matrix. Along with listing the process of writing the COs and mapping of CO - PO course articulation matrix, this article starts by giving the background information regarding NBA , Vision and Mission statements, the need for OBE and Rubrics. National Board of Accreditation National Board of Accreditation ( NBA ) is responsible for the accreditation of higher education institutions in India. NBA is also a full member of the Washington Accord . NBA accredits programmes and not the institutions. If an institution is planning to apply for NBA accreditation for a department, then in Criterion 3.1 of Self Assessment Report ( SAR ) of NBA document, you are explicitly asked to mention the CO - PO mapping for a minimum of 8 core courses. So before applying for NBA accreditation, the concerned department should make sure that their COs are well defined and serves the purpose of Outcome Based Education ( OBE ). Institutions adopting OBE try to bring changes to the curriculum by dynamically adopting to the requirements of the different stakeholders like Students, Parents, Industry Personnel and Recruiters. Higher Education Institutions in India are classified into two categories by NBA Tier - 1 Institutions consists of all IITs, NITs, Central Universities, State Universities and Autonomous Institutions. Tier - 1 institutions can also claim the benefits as per the Washington Accord. Tier - 2 Institutions consists of affiliated colleges of Universities. You should define Institute Vision and Mission and Department Vision and Mission to comply with the tradition, culture and ethos of your institution. Institution Vision: Vision is a picture of the future you seek to create, described in the present tense, as if it were happening now. It shows where we want to go, and what we will be like when we get there. Institution Mission: Mission statement defines what an institution is, why the institution exists, its reason for being. It defines what are we here to do together. Department Vision The vision and mission of the department should be correlated with the mission and vision of the institution. Department Mission A mission statement might include a brief history and philosophy of the academic programme, the type of students to be served, the academic environment and primary focus of the curriculum, faculty roles, outreach to the community and the role of research. A senior professor who has undergone NBA training should be designated as NBA coordinator for a programme. What is Outcome Based Education ( OBE )? Institutions adopting OBE try to bring changes to the curriculum by dynamically adapting to the requirements of the different stakeholders like Students, Parents, Industry Personnel and Recruiters. OBE is all about feedback and outcomes. Four levels of outcomes from OBE are: Program Outcomes (POs) Course Outcomes (COs) Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) Why OBE ? International recognition and global employment opportunities. More employable and innovative graduates with professional and soft skills, social responsibility and ethics. Better visibility and reputation of the technical institution among stakeholders. Improving the commitment and involvement of all the stakeholders. Enabling graduates to excel in their profession and accomplish greater heights in their careers. Preparing graduates for the leadership positions and challenging them and making them aware of the opportunities in the technology development. Benefits of OBE for Faculty Members Faculty members are referred to as Change of Agents in OBE . Teaching will become a far more creative and innovative career. Faculty members will no longer feel the pressure of having to be the \"source of all knowledge\". Faculty members shape the thinking and vision of students towards a course. Program Outcomes (POs) POs describe what students should know and be able to do at the end of the programme. POs are to be in line with the graduate attributes as specified in the Washington Accord. POs are to be specific, measurable and achievable. NBA has defined 12 POs and you need not define those POs by yourself and it is common for all the institutions in India. In the syllabus book given to students, there should be clear mention of course objectives and course outcomes along with CO - PO course articulation matrix for all the courses. Course Outcomes (COs) Course outcomes are the statements of what a student should know, understand and/or be able to demonstrate after completion of a course. While writing COs for a course, please remember the following points. The COs must state the major skills, knowledge, attitude or ability that students will acquire. COs should be expressed in terms of measurable and/or observable behaviors. COs should be agreed upon by the faculty in a program and should drive program outcomes. All the courses in the department should have a uniform number of COs. The COs should be written by Professors who have demonstrated considerable expertise in that course and then identify the textbook for the course. The syllabus book should have course articulation matrix for CO - PO mapping of all the courses. There should be a minimum of 6 COs according to the NBA . Course outcomes should begin with an action verb from Bloom's taxonomy. Here is a sample list of COs written for Python Programming course. Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) Program Educational Objectives (PEOs) should be defined by the Department HEAD in consultation with the faculty members. PEOs are an promise by the Department HEAD to the aspiring students about what they will achieve once they join the programme. PEO assessment is not compulsory in India as it is quite difficult to measure in Indian context. NBA Assessors usually do not ask for PEO assessment. PEOs are about professional and career accomplishment after 4 to 5 years of graduation. PEOs can be written from different perspectives like Career, Technical Competency and Behavior. While writing the PEOs do not use the technical terms as it will be read by prospective students who wants to join the programme. Three to five PEOs are recommended. Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) Program Specific Outcomes (PSOs) are statements that describe what the graduates of a specific engineering program should be able to do. A list of PSOs written for the department of Computer Science and Engineering at Dr.Ambedkar Institute of Technology, Bengaluru is given below. PSO1 : To apply the knowledge obtained through rigorous analysis of algorithms for advancing the broad area of computer science and engineering. PSO2 : To bring forth the creative zeal and work efficiently in designing the solution to various software and hardware problems by using state of the art tools. PSO3 : To assimilate professional ethics, managerial skills and to officiate effectively as a leader in a team to manage diverse projects. Blooms Taxonomy Bloom's taxonomy is considered as the global language for education. Bloom's Taxonomy is frequently used by teachers in writing the course outcomes as it provides a ready made structure and list of action verbs. Here is the revised Bloom's document with action verbs, which we frequently refer to while writing COs for our courses. CO - PO Course Articulation Matrix Mapping Course Articulation Matrix shows the educational relationship (Level of Learning achieved) between Course Outcomes and Program Outcomes for a Course. This matrix strongly indicates whether the students are able to achieve the course learning objectives. The matrix can be used for any course and is a good way to evaluate a course syllabus. The below table (Table 1) gives information about the action verbs used in the POs and the nature of POs, stating whether the POs are technical or non-technical. You need to understand the intention of each POs and the Bloom's level to which each of these action verbs in the POs correlates to. Once you have understood the POs then you can write the COs for a course and see to what extent each of those COs correlate with the POs. ​ Table 1: Process for mapping the values for CO - PO Matrix Type POs Action Verb(s) in POs Bloom's level(s) for POs Bloom's level(s) for COs Technical PO1 Apply L3 Bloom's L1 to L4 -> Theory Courses Blooms's L1 to L5 -> Laboratory Courses Bloom's L1 to L6 -> Mini Project and Main Project PO2 Identify L2 Formulate L6 Review L2 PO3 Design L6 Develop L3, L6 PO4 Analyze L4 Interpret L2, L3 Design L6 PO5 Create L6 Select L1, L2, L6 Apply L3 Non-Technical PO6 THUMB RULE If Bloom's L1 Action Verbs of a CO -> Correlates with any of PO6 to PO12 -> then assign 1 If Bloom's L2 to L3 Action Verbs of a CO -> Correlates with any of PO6 to PO12 -> then assign 2 If Bloom's L4 to L6 Action Verbs of a CO -> Correlates with any of PO6 to PO12 -> then assign 3 PO7 PO8 PO9 PO10 PO11 PO12 NOTE : The first five POs are purely of technical in nature, while the other POs are non-technical. For the theory courses, while writing the COs, you need to restrict yourself between Blooms Level 1 to Level 4. Again, if it is a programming course, restrict yourself between Blooms Level 1 to Level 3 but for the other courses, you can go up to Blooms Level 4. For the laboratory courses, while composing COs, you need to restrict yourself between Blooms Level 1 to Level 5. Only for Mini-project and Main project, you may extend up to Blooms Level 6 while composing COs. For a given course, the course in-charge has to involve all the other Professors who teach that course and ask them to come up with the CO - PO mapping. The course in-charge has to take the average value of all of these CO - PO mappings and finalize the values or the course in-charge can go with what the majority of the faculty members prefer for. Ensure that none of the Professors who are handling the particular course discuss with each other while marking the CO - PO values. If you want to match your COs with non-technical POs, then correlate the action verbs used in the course COs with the thumb rule given in the table and map the values. (Applies only for mapping COs to non-technical POs) . Tips for Assigning the values while mapping COs to POs. Select action verbs for a CO from different Bloom's levels based on the importance of the particular CO for the given course. Stick on to single action verbs while composing COs but you may go for multiple action verbs if the need arises. You need to justify for marking of the values in CO - PO articulation matrix. Use a combination of words found in the COs, POs and your course syllabus for writing the justification. Restrict yourself to one or two lines. Values to CO - PO (technical POs in particular) matrix can be assigned by ​ a. Judging the importance of the particular CO in relation to the POs. If the CO matches strongly with a particular PO criterion then assign 3, if it matches moderately then assign 2 or if the match is low then assign 1 else mark with \" - \" symbol. ​ b. If an action verb used in a CO is repeated at multiple Bloom's levels, then you need to judge which Bloom's level is the best fit for that action verb. A sample CO - PO Course Articulation matrix mapping for the Python Programming course. You can also find a list of COs and CO - PO course articulation matrix mapping for the Python programming course here What is Rubrics? We strongly recommend all the institutions to adopt Rubrics. Rubrics is a scoring guide that is used to evaluate the quality of students' constructed responses. Usually Rubrics is designed for laboratory, projects and seminar courses. In Indian universities, there is a trend of allocating the marks based on face value of the students and there is no appropriate breakup of the marks for the course. Usually, a faculty sees a student and allocates marks based on his opinion about the student. This tends to have negative effect on the student as there is no transparency in allocation of marks. We can overcome these kind of problems by adopting and designing Rubrics. More about Rubrics can be found here . Advantages: 1) Sets focus on the stated objectives. 2) Sets a common framework and language for assessment. 3) Grading consistency among the students and faculty members. 4) Enables peer review among the students themselves. 5) Clear Instructions to students on the intended outcomes. 6) Diagnosing specific Strengths and Weaknesses among students. Faculty members should always distribute the Rubrics designed for a course to the students so that they do understand how they are accessed. Few Clarifications Course: A semester consists of 5 to 6 theory courses and 2 to 3 laboratory courses. A course is a unit of teaching. We Indians tend to use the term Subject instead of Course . Please avoid the use of the term \"Subject\". Use the term Course instead of subject. The term Programme is different from the Department. Programme: An programme is a cohesive arrangement of courses, co-curricular and extra-curricular activities to accomplish predetermined objectives leading to the award of individual degrees like B.E., B.Tech, M.Tech and Ph.D. from a department. A department can offer different programmes. Degree: Academic award conferred upon a student upon successful completion of a programme. For example, B.E. Degree Programme, B.Tech Degree Programme, M.E. Degree Programme and M.Tech Degree Programme. Output and Outcome: These two terms can be explained easily with an example. If you produce Ph.D students then it is Output . If the Ph.D students are able to get funds and publish papers then it is Outcome . Take the above information with a pinch of salt and do not consider it as gospel.

What is NPTEL ? NPTEL is an acronym for National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning which is an initiative by seven Indian Institutes of Technology ( IIT Bombay, Delhi, Guwahati, Kanpur, Kharagpur, Madras and Roorkee) and Indian Institute of Science (IISc) for creating course contents in engineering and science. NPTEL provides E-learning through online Web and Video courses in Engineering, Science and humanities streams. Course contents will be useful for training the faculty members and through them improve the quality of students. You can join/register NPTEL courses and access the materials for free. You have to pay a nominal amount only if you are registering for exams, leading to certification in your chosen course. Also, most of the institutions refund the amount that you have paid for NPTEL certification. Advantages of Earning Certification from NPTEL Most of the NPTEL courses are offered by premier institutions like IITs and IISc. NPTEL certifications have become mandatory for promotions in most of the academic institutions and recruiters prefer students with NPTEL certifications. Few universities are also asking their students to take up and get certified as part of their course work. Credits earned from NPTEL courses are also recognized by most of the universities. NPTEL Certifications are also approved and recognized as Faculty Development Programme ( FDP ) by AICTE . So, NPTEL offers a scintillating opportunity to move our career forward and also to enhance our knowledge at our own pace and at less cost. Here are few tips to ace the NPTEL courses drawn from my personal experience. Rather than watching the videos, download the transcripts in PDF format. Personally, I feel it is easy to go through the transcripts. Take the printouts of all the PDFs beforehand itself. Do not wait for the arrival of the mail saying that video has been released for the particular week. You can find the PDFs of all the week at the beginning of the course. Try to solve the assignments religiously. Remember that for 4 week courses, only 3 best assignments are considered out of 4 assignments 8 week courses, only 6 best assignments are considered out of 8 assignments 12 week courses, only 8 best assignments are considered out of 12 assignments As you can see, you can miss few assignments but DO NOT if you are really serious about your course. Try to submit the assignments within deadline as there will not be any extension. For NPTEL courses, assignment marks contribute 25% of the final score and exam marks contribute to 75% of the final score. NPTEL Final Score = 25% of Assignment Marks + 75% of the Exam Marks With good effort, you can easily crack most of the courses as the pass percentage is 40% (Assignment Marks + Exam Marks). By analyzing the assignments questions, you can gauge the kind of questions that will be asked in exams. These NPTEL courses are part of a life long learning process. Prepare notes for each unit. You can always come back and refer these notes whenever necessary. Most of the courses have questions in Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs) format. Programming courses tend to be a little difficult in comparison to theoretical courses. You need to put a lot of effort into understanding the basics of programming concepts. Usually, NPTEL allocates exam centers at different locations rather than nearer to the residential/office address that you had provided while registering for your exam. Plan and Schedule your travel appropriately. Revise your course notes the previous day of your exam and get good sleep. Do not forget to drink lots of water. All I say is, take the course that is of interest to you, put effort and hope for good. Good Luck!!","tags":"Articles","url":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/tips-for-passing-the-courses-offered-by-nptel.html","loc":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/tips-for-passing-the-courses-offered-by-nptel.html"},{"title":"Introduction to Python Programming","text":"Introduction to Python Programming The Git repository for the book containing the code examples from the book \"Introduction to Python Programming\" , authored by Gowrishankar S. and Veena A. and published by CRC Press/Taylor and Francis, Boca Raton, USA can be found here Book Purchase You can purchase the book at following sources.

To do so, open the Terminal window on raspberry pi and type the following command ifconfig As can be seen from the screenshot, Raspberry Pi is connected to the Wireless LAN and the address is 172.16.2.100. It may vary on your Raspberry Pi. Make a note of this address. Step 4: Once you have obtained the Address, go to your home directory and create a folder as shown in the below screenshot. This folder is used to store the Python programs. Step 5: Invoke your PyCharm IDE . Create a new Project. Go to File —> New Project —> Pure Python —> Give a Project Name. In my case it is RaspberryPiProject. Step 6: Right Click on RaspberryPiProject and select New —> Python File and give a name to python file. In my case it is rasp.py Step 7: Write the line print \"Hello RaspberryPi\" in the editor. Step 8: Now go to File —> Settings On the left pane of the window you should see Project:RaspberryPiProject. (If you have given a different name then it may differ from what is displayed here) Expand it and Click on Project Interpreter On the right pane of the window, click at the end of Project Interpreter and select Add Remote option as shown below. A Remote Python Interpreter window pops up. Step 9: Configure the Remote Python Interpreter window. Write the IP address of the Raspberry Pi you earlier made note of in the Host option. Give the user name and password. Specify the Python interpreter path on raspberry pi. Click OK . Now you should see the Python Interpreter found in Raspberry Pi. Step 10: Now go to Tools —> Deployment —> Configuration and click on + sign on the left pane. You should see a window. At this stage Raspberry Pi will be treated as a Server machine. Give a name to your Raspberry Pi server (in my case it is GS_Research) and select the type as SFTP and click OK Step 11: Click on the Connections tab and specify the IP address of the Raspberry Pi again in SFTP host Leave the port and Root path as it is. Specify the User Name and Password Then click on Mappings tab. Specify the local path where you have stored the python project in the Windows machine. Then specify the path which we had created to store the Python programs on raspberry pi i.e., /home/pi/pywork and click OK . Step 12: Now we need to upload the Python file created on a Windows machine on to Raspberry Pi and compile the program using Raspberry Pi Python Interpreter. Go to Tools —> Deployment —> Upload to GS_Research. Remember, here GS_Research is the name given to the Raspberry Pi server. At the bottom pane, you can see that the file is successfully uploaded. Now open the terminal window again on the Raspberry Pi and go to the path where you intended to store Python programs. If you have followed the instructions then the path is /home/pi/pywork. You should see the rasp.py file in there. Step 13: You need to sync the Python code with Raspberry Pi as and when you write your code in PyCharm. To do that go to Tools —> Deployment —> Sync with Deployed to GS_Research.

This made me to think, what might be the best way to collect and sort these papers? I thought of coming up with a naming convention for these papers based on requirements as mentioned below. On any given day, I should be able to pick the exact paper belonging to a particular faculty. Keep track of number of papers published by each faculty. Whether the paper is published in Journal or Conference. Ability to sort the papers year wise. Based on the above requirements I devised the following way to name each file. Paper name is divided into six components. Each of these components is separated by a Hyphen. First component is the type of paper. If the paper is published in International Journal then use the Keyword IJ , likewise for International Conference use IC , for National Journal use NJ and for National Conference use NC Second component is the name of the concerned faculty. Use the first three letters of the faculty name. For e.g., if the faculty name is Patrick.G.S then the second component will be PAT . Third component is the initials of the concerned faculty. So w.r.t. the above name the third component will be GS (exclude dots). Fourth component is the month in which the paper was published. For e.g., if the paper is published in the month of March then use the numeral 03. (prefix 0 for single digits) Fifth component is the year in which the paper was published. For e.g., if the paper is published in the year 2016 then it'll be the fifth component. Sixth component is the count of the number of papers the faculty has published under a particular category of IJ or IC or NJ or NC . Based on the requirements discussed, if for e.g., Prof. Patrick.G.S has published in 2 International Journals and in 2 International Conferences then the nomenclature for these papers will be as shown below: For International Journal IJ - PAT - GS -03-2016-1 IJ - PAT - GS -05-2016-2 For International Conference IC - PAT - GS -10-2016-1 IC - PAT - GS -11-2016-2","tags":"Articles","url":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/nomenclature-for-naming-published-research-papers.html","loc":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/nomenclature-for-naming-published-research-papers.html"},{"title":"MySQL Programming with Python using MySQL Python Connector","text":"Introduction This article is about programming MySQL with Python using MySQL Python Connector. MySQL is a popular Open Source Database that finds its way in the software stack of almost all newer billion dollar companies. Let's try to do some basic operations like Insert , Read , Update and Delete . For creating the database schema we have used MySQL workbench, even though it is fully possible to do the same programmatically using Python and the MySQL Python Connector. For our article I have considered this below database schema. You can read more about designing this schema here . The illustrated code has been tested on Python 3.5 with MySQL Python Connector. MySQL Programming With Python Using MySQL Python Connector Install the latest version of MySQL Python Connector as shown below In line 1, we import mysql.connector module. In line 2 we also import the errorcode class which can be used to various errors related to Database query. In line 3-4 we import faker module and create fake object. The reason for using this awesome module is I wanted to have some real world values generated for me instead of writing the values manually. You can read more about faker module here . You need to declare and provide values for user , password , host , database and raise_on_warnings . Here, config is declared as a dictionary. You need to pass this config dictionary to connect method as an argument (see ** in the connect method). In line 21 we create cursor object which can be used to execute the Database query. We write a query to insert a row to the contactperson table. The query is stored in the variable addContactPerson which is passed to the execute method as an argument. In this program we will use an for loop to insert ten rows. Once we have performed our operation we need to close the cnx and cursor objects. import mysql.connector from mysql.connector import errorcode from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create () config = { 'user' : 'root' , 'password' : 'mysql123' , 'host' : 'localhost' , 'database' : 'contactmanagerapplication' , 'raise_on_warnings' : True , } #This is the most efficient way of toggling between the values import itertools toggle = itertools . cycle ([ 'Male' , 'Female' ]) #next(toggle) try : cnx = mysql . connector . connect ( ** config ) cursor = cnx . cursor () #Let's insert ten rows to contactperson table for person in range ( 1 , 11 ): contactPersonID = person firstName = fake . first_name_male () #generate fake first name lastName = fake . last_name_male () #generate fake middle name middleName = fake . last_name_male () #generate fake last name dateOfBirth = fake . date () #generate fake DOB contactPersonType = next ( toggle ) #In SQL statement the values need to be enclosed within double quotes #I'm providing the same by explicity specifying double quotes and removing it's special meaning addContactPerson = \"INSERT INTO contactmanagerapplication.contactperson(\" \\ \"ContactPersonID, FirstName, MiddleName, LastName, DateOfBirth,\" \\ \"ContactPersonType)VALUES( {} , \\\" {} \\\" , \\\" {} \\\" , \\\" {} \\\" , \\\" {} \\\" , \\\" {} \\\" )\" . \\ format ( contactPersonID , firstName , lastName , middleName , dateOfBirth , contactPersonType ) cursor . execute ( addContactPerson ) cnx . commit () except mysql . connector . Error as err : if err . errno == errorcode . ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR : print ( \"Something is wrong with your user name or password\" ) elif err . errno == errorcode . ER_BAD_DB_ERROR : print ( \"Database does not exist\" ) else : print ( err ) else : cursor . close () cnx . close () In the below code we select and display all the rows from the contactperson table. Once we have composed and executed the select query, we have to use the cursor object along with for loop to display all the rows. In line 19, we specify variable names that correspond to the attributes in the table contactperson . We then use these variable names to display the values. import mysql.connector from mysql.connector import errorcode config = { 'user' : 'root' , 'password' : 'mysql123' , 'host' : 'localhost' , 'database' : 'contactmanagerapplication' , 'raise_on_warnings' : True , } try : cnx = mysql . connector . connect ( ** config ) cursor = cnx . cursor () #Let's read all the rows in the table readContactPerson = \"select * from contactmanagerapplication.contactperson\" cursor . execute ( readContactPerson ) #specify the attributes that you want to display for ( contactPersonID , firstName , lastName , middleName , dateOfBirth , contactPersonType ) in cursor : print ( \" {} , {} , {} , {} , {} , {} \" . format ( contactPersonID , firstName , middleName , lastName , dateOfBirth , contactPersonID )) cnx . commit () except mysql . connector . Error as err : if err . errno == errorcode . ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR : print ( \"Something is wrong with your user name or password\" ) elif err . errno == errorcode . ER_BAD_DB_ERROR : print ( \"Database does not exist\" ) else : print ( err ) else : cursor . close () cnx . close () </ pre > Below code asks the user to enter the contactPersonID number which needs to be deleted. Based on the value that the user has entered the related row gets deleted in the table. import mysql.connector from mysql.connector import errorcode config = { 'user' : 'root' , 'password' : 'mysql123' , 'host' : 'localhost' , 'database' : 'contactmanagerapplication' , 'raise_on_warnings' : True , } try : cnx = mysql . connector . connect ( ** config ) cursor = cnx . cursor () contactPersonID = input ( \"Enter the ContactPersonID to be deleted\" ) #Let's remove a row in contactperson table by specifying the contactPersonID deleteContactPerson = \"DELETE FROM contactmanagerapplication.contactperson where ContactPersonID = {} \" . format ( contactPersonID ) cursor . execute ( deleteContactPerson ) cnx . commit () except mysql . connector . Error as err : if err . errno == errorcode . ER_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR : print ( \"Something is wrong with your user name or password\" ) elif err . errno == errorcode . ER_BAD_DB_ERROR : print ( \"Database does not exist\" ) else : print ( err ) else : cursor . close () cnx . close () Below code is used to update an attribute of a particular row based on user input. import mysql.connector from mysql.connector import errorcode from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create () config = { 'user' : 'root' , 'password' : 'mysql123' , 'host' : 'localhost' , 'database' : 'contactmanagerapplication' , 'raise_on_warnings' : True , } try : cnx = mysql . connector . connect ( ** config ) cursor = cnx . cursor () contactPersonID = input ( 'Enter the Contact Person ID whose records needs to be updated' ) firstName = fake . first_name_male () #generate fake first name #Let's update a row in contactperson table by specifying the contactPersonID updateContactPerson = \"UPDATE contactmanagerapplication.contactperson SET FirstName = \\\" {} \\\" WHERE ContactPersonID = {} \" . format ( firstName , contactPersonID ) cursor . execute ( updateContactPerson ) cnx . commit () except mysql . connector .

MySQL Workbench helps us to create visual data model which can be translated into a physical database on the MySQL Database Server. For demonstration purpose we'll be designing an Contact Manager Application Database. This DB has four tables namely ContactPerson, Address, EmailAddress and PhoneNumber. I'll not be discussing various DB issues like Normalization, Entity-Relationship( ER )/Enhanced Entity-Relationship( EER ) models or SQL programming. Please refer to the various fine materials available. Below are few recommended textbooks: Database Design for Mere Mortals: A Hands-On Guide to Relational Database Design Beginning Database Design: From Novice to Professional SQL in 10 Minutes, Sams Teach Yourself Learning SQL Head First SQL : Your Brain on SQL — A Learner's Guide Download the latest version of MySQL Database here . Make sure that you have downloaded the community edition of MySQL. Steps Involved In Designing Database Schema I presume that you already have a working copy of MySQL installed in your system. Step 1: Invoke MySQL workbench. That should look like the below screen. The top Window Pane displays MySQL Connections. There can be any number of MySQL instances. Here we have one instance of MySQL connection with root user. The bottom pane shows the Models that you have created. The right window pane shows shortcuts to various MySQL tools. We'll create Visual Data Models and then it'll be converted to the actual physical database schema on the MySQL database server. Remember, creation of Data Models doesn't mean that you have already created actual physical database schema. In the Models window pane click on the + sign. Step 2: You will see a screen as shown below. By default the DB schema is named as mydb. Let's change this. Double click on mydb in the Physical Schemas window pane. In the bottom window pane change the name from mydb to ContactManagerApplication. In the Refactor Schema windows click on OK button. Step 3: Double click on Add Table. Step 4: You will see the below screen. Step 5: Change the table name to ContactPerson. Also, fill the Column Name or attributes with various values with appropriate data types as shown in the below screen. Step 6: Add another table called Address and fill the Column Name with various values with appropriate data types as shown in the below screen. Step 7: Add another table called EmailAddress and fill the Column Name with various values with appropriate data types as shown in the below screen. Step 8: Add another table called PhoneNumber and fill the Column Name with various values with appropriate data types as shown in the below screen. Step 9: Click on Save button in the Menu bar. Save the data model as ContactManagerApplication in some folder. At this stage we have created all the tables for our schema and have saved the model. We have still not converted this model to actual physical database on MySQL database server. Lets' migrate these models to connect to MySQL Database. Step 10: Go to the menu bar and click on Database and select Forward Engineer. In the Forward Engineer to Database window, various parameters have been set. This depends on your configuration while installing MySQL database. I'm using the Local Instance of MySQL and root user. Leave the Default Schema blank. This forward engineering generates all the SQL code to create a physical database on the target server. Click on Next button. Give the Password for the root User and click on OK button. Click on Next button. In the window you can see the SQL script that has been generated by the MySQL workbench. You can review the script and save the script as a file and click on Next button. Again, give the Password for the root User and click on OK . Click on Close button. Step 11: From the previous step(Forward Engineering) we have generated the SQL script for our models. We'll use Reverse Engineering to connect the generated SQL script to the SQL Server database thereby creating the actual physical database on the SQL Server. Go to Database in the menu and click on Reverse Engineer. Again, you see the default parameters that are set and click on Next button. Give the Password for root User and click on OK button. Click on Next button. Now at this stage you can see the available list of various Database schemas. Select the contactmanagerapplication checkbox and click on Next button. Give Password for the root User and click on OK button. Click on Next button. Click on Execute button. Click on Next button. Click on Finish button. Step 12: An EER diagram will be automatically generated by the MySQL workbench. It shows the data model which we have created. Let's establish relation between various tables. Click on the highlighted button (which is an 1 to many relation) in the column bar. First click on the name on whose side the many relationship should come and then click on the name on whose side 1 relationship should come. For e.g., to establish 1 to many relationship between address table and contactperson table, first click on ContactPersonID in the address table and then click on ContactPersonID in the contactperson table. Repeat the above process between other tables to establish a relationship as shown below. Step 13: In the previous step, we have established the relationship between various tables as seen in the EER diagram. But this relationship is not reflected in the actual physical database schema which we have created. To do so, we have to synchronize between the actual physical database schema and the data model. Go to menu and click on Database and select Synchronize Model. When ever there is some changes done to the data model as seen in the EER diagram it won't get reflected automatically in the Database Schema. We have to synchronize the changes done to the data model as displayed in EER diagram with the Database Schema to see the changes. Click on Next button. Click on Next button. Enter the Password for root User. Click on OK button. Click on Next button. Select the checkbox and click on Next button. Click on Next button. The tool compares all aspects of the current data model with the actual physical MySQL Database schema and lists out the difference between the current data model and the actual physical Database schema. Click on Next button. You'll be able to see a sequence of SQL scripts. Click on execute button. Give the Password for root User and click on OK button. Click on close button. Step 14: To see whether the data model has been migrated to the MySQL database, go to menu and click on Database and select Connect to Database. Click on OK button. On the left pane you can see the contactmanagerapplication database schema and expand it see the list of tables.

Here, I'll not dwell deep into how testing is done in Python. But I'll discuss the proper way of configuring PyCharm IDE with pytest testing tool to get the things up and running. This article is tested on a Windows 10 machine running PyCharm Professional Edition 4.5 with Python 2.7.9 interpreter. Background PyCharm is a popular IDE for Python Programming. More information about PyCharm can be obtained at https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/ . As a rule, the code we develop should be thoroughly tested before its release. Testing is a very important topic and has been discussed in great detail in the fine material. More information about pytest testing tool can be obtained at http://pytest.org/. To gain more knowledge about testing techniques in general please refer to below books. Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship Agile Testing: A Practical Guide for Testers and Agile Teams Software Testing: A Craftsman's Approach, Fourth Edition Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java 8 with JUnit Practical Unit Testing with JUnit and Mockito Effective Unit Testing: A guide for Java developers The Art of Unit Testing: with Examples in . NET Even though some of these books target other programming languages, still the knowledge that you gain from reading these books can be applied to Python Testing also. Steps Involved in Configuring PyCharm to work with pytest Testing Tool Here I assume that you have already configured your PyCharm IDE to run Python Interpreter. If not, you can download anaconda from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ and use it to configure the Python interpreter in PyCharm IDE . Step 1: In order to follow this tutorial, create a folder called PyArticle in C: drive. Install pytest testing tool using pip command as shown below. Step 2: Invoke PyCharm IDE and go to File -> New Project. Specify the path to the folder you created and also specify the name of the project. In our case the name of the project is TestExample. Press Create button. This takes you to the PyCharm editor. Step 3: Right Click on TestExample folder on the left pane of the PyCharm editor. Select New -> Python File Step 4: Give the file name as add_two_numbers Step 5: Write the below given code in add_two_numbers.py file. This is a very simple code that adds up two numbers and returns the result. Step 6: Now go to File -> Settings Step 7: In the Settings window, click on Python Integrated Tools in the right pane and select py.test as the Default test runner. Click on OK button. Step 8: Now right click on TestExample directory and select New -> Directory. Step 9: Enter the directory name as Tests. We will have all our test files in a separate directory which is a good practice. Step 10: Right click on Tests directory and select New -> Python File. Step 11: Give the file name as test_add_two_numbers and click OK . Step 12: Write the below code in test_add_two_numbers.py file. Notice that the word test_ has been prefixed for the test method. All test methods should start with test_. This is a very important step in the configuration and if the test method doesn't start with test_ then you won't be able to get proper output. assert is used to check whether the condition is True or False. Step 13: Go to Run -> Edit Configurations. Step 14: In the Run/Debug Configurations window click on the + button found on the upper left corner. Go to Python tests and select py.test. Click OK button. Step 15: On the left pane you can see Python tests is created. In the right pane for the Name text box give the value as py.test in test_add_two_numbers.py You should always prefix the Python test file name with the words py.test in. For the Target text box specify the path to the Python test file. For the Working directory text box specify the path to the directory which has the Python test files. Click on OK button. Step 16: Right click on the Python test file and select Run. As you can see in the Test Results the green color indicates that the test has successfully passed. Step 17: What if you want to specify more than one test method? Lets find out the process to achieve the same. Create another python file called multiply_two_numbers and fill it up with the code shown below. Create another Python test file called test_queue_example. Fill it up with the code shown below. While configuring the Python test file as shown in Step 13 – 15 check the Options check box and give the value as -q . Here q stands for queue. Click on OK button after all the configurations are done. Now right click on the latest test file and run. As you can see one test got passed while the other got failed. Change the code in test_queue_example as shown below and run the test program again. You can see that both the tests have passed. Happy Coding!!! Points of Interest Testing our code is a very important aspect of software development. Using testing tools like pytest along with PyCharm IDE goes in a long way in developing quality code.","tags":"Articles","url":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/using-pytest-testing-tool-to-test-python-code-by-configuring-pycharm-ide.html","loc":"https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/using-pytest-testing-tool-to-test-python-code-by-configuring-pycharm-ide.html"}]};
