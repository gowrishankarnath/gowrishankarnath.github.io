Despite my best efforts, I could not find a step by step tutorial on how to remotely connect PyCharm to Raspberry Pi and use the Raspberry Pi python interpreter to execute the programs. So I'm listing out the steps here. This tutorial is tested on a Windows 10 machine and Raspberry Pi running Raspbian OS . Step 1: Ensure the Windows Machine and Raspberry Pi are part of the same Network. Step 2: Install PyCharm Professional Edition on your Windows machine. Step 3: You need to get the IP Address of Raspberry Pi. To do so, open the Terminal window on raspberry pi and type the following command ifconfig As can be seen from the screenshot, Raspberry Pi is connected to the Wireless LAN and the address is 172.16.2.100. It may vary on your Raspberry Pi. Make a note of this address. Step 4: Once you have obtained the Address, go to your home directory and create a folder as shown in the below screenshot. This folder is used to store the Python programs. Step 5: Invoke your PyCharm IDE . Create a new Project. Go to File —> New Project —> Pure Python —> Give a Project Name. In my case it is RaspberryPiProject. Step 6: Right Click on RaspberryPiProject and select New —> Python File and give a name to python file. In my case it is rasp.py Step 7: Write the line print \"Hello RaspberryPi\" in the editor. Step 8: Now go to File —> Settings On the left pane of the window you should see Project:RaspberryPiProject. (If you have given a different name then it may differ from what is displayed here) Expand it and Click on Project Interpreter On the right pane of the window, click at the end of Project Interpreter and select Add Remote option as shown below. A Remote Python Interpreter window pops up. Step 9: Configure the Remote Python Interpreter window. Write the IP address of the Raspberry Pi you earlier made note of in the Host option. Give the user name and password. Specify the Python interpreter path on raspberry pi. Click OK . Now you should see the Python Interpreter found in Raspberry Pi. Step 10: Now go to Tools —> Deployment —> Configuration and click on + sign on the left pane. You should see a window. At this stage Raspberry Pi will be treated as a Server machine. Give a name to your Raspberry Pi server (in my case it is GS_Research) and select the type as SFTP and click OK Step 11: Click on the Connections tab and specify the IP address of the Raspberry Pi again in SFTP host Leave the port and Root path as it is. Specify the User Name and Password Then click on Mappings tab. Specify the local path where you have stored the python project in the Windows machine. Then specify the path which we had created to store the Python programs on raspberry pi i.e., /home/pi/pywork and click OK . Step 12: Now we need to upload the Python file created on a Windows machine on to Raspberry Pi and compile the program using Raspberry Pi Python Interpreter. Go to Tools —> Deployment —> Upload to GS_Research. Remember, here GS_Research is the name given to the Raspberry Pi server. At the bottom pane, you can see that the file is successfully uploaded. Now open the terminal window again on the Raspberry Pi and go to the path where you intended to store Python programs. If you have followed the instructions then the path is /home/pi/pywork. You should see the rasp.py file in there. Step 13: You need to sync the Python code with Raspberry Pi as and when you write your code in PyCharm. To do that go to Tools —> Deployment —> Sync with Deployed to GS_Research.

This made me to think, what might be the best way to collect and sort these papers? I thought of coming up with a naming convention for these papers based on requirements as mentioned below. On any given day, I should be able to pick the exact paper belonging to a particular faculty. Keep track of number of papers published by each faculty. Whether the paper is published in Journal or Conference. Ability to sort the papers year wise. Based on the above requirements I devised the following way to name each file. Paper name is divided into six components. Each of these components is separated by a Hyphen. First component is the type of paper. If the paper is published in International Journal then use the Keyword IJ , likewise for International Conference use IC , for National Journal use NJ and for National Conference use NC Second component is the name of the concerned faculty. Use the first three letters of the faculty name. For e.g., if the faculty name is Patrick.G.S then the second component will be PAT . Third component is the initials of the concerned faculty. So w.r.t. the above name the third component will be GS (exclude dots). Fourth component is the month in which the paper was published. For e.g., if the paper is published in the month of March then use the numeral 03. (prefix 0 for single digits) Fifth component is the year in which the paper was published. For e.g., if the paper is published in the year 2016 then it'll be the fifth component. Sixth component is the count of the number of papers the faculty has published under a particular category of IJ or IC or NJ or NC . Based on the requirements discussed, if for e.g., Prof. Patrick.G.S has published in 2 International Journals and in 2 International Conferences then the nomenclature for these papers will be as shown below: For International Journal IJ - PAT - GS -03-2016-1 IJ - PAT - GS -05-2016-2 For International Conference IC - PAT - GS -10-2016-1 IC - PAT - GS -11-2016-2","tags":"Articles","url":"/nomenclature-for-naming-published-research-papers.html","loc":"/nomenclature-for-naming-published-research-papers.html"},{"title":"Generate Fake Data Programmatically Using Faker With Python","text":"Introduction Recently, I had a requirement to fill the database with some data. Filling the tables manually proved to be very tedious enough. So, I was looking for some software that could do the heavy lifting for me and also that could be used with Python natively. Voila!! After a bit of search came across this awesome software. FAKER Faker can be used to generate fake data which resembles the real world values rather than some gibberish values. Using FAKER With Python The following code has been tested using Python 3.5 on a Windows 10 machine. Type the below command in the Command Prompt to install Faker module Let's start with a very simple example. Import the faker module and make use of the Factory Class. Use create() method to create an object called fake. Say, if you want to print a name then use the object fake along with name() method as shown below. from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create () print ( fake . name ()) Output Mrs. Kenley Farrell You can even localize the names according to your preferences. For e.g, if you want to display name in Hindi (India), then pass the string argument \"hi_IN\" to create() method. from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create ( \"hi_IN\" ) print ( fake . name ()) Ouput रचना बाबू If you want to display 10 random currencies from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create () for i in range ( 10 ): print ( fake . currency_code ()) Output MWK MRO KES TOP IQD MYR PGK MDL NIO MNT You can randomly generate addresses using address() method. Below code is localized for \"en_US\". from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create ( \"en_US\" ) for i in range ( 10 ): print ( fake . address ()) Output PSC 7452, Box 9044 APO AA 06906-4518 65264 Vince Points Suite 897 North Pearlene, PA 66031 63876 Daijah Pass New Rickiland, NM 82820 59116 Mueller Port South Rosanne, IN 07663 486 Jerde Forest New Keyshawnfort, GA 59913-5859 360 Orie Forge Lake Izayah, NY 83459-8476 1840 O'Connell Field Apt. 566 Port Zakaryton, HI 66433-8319 PSC 2512, Box 6095 APO AP 37389 89957 Williamson Burg Apt. 255 Shelliview, WY 06711-9241 78580 Vanessa Square Apt. 095 West Sherie, CT 67665 You can generate various information about a person using different methods as shown below. from faker import Factory fake = Factory . create ( \"en_US\" ) print ( fake . last_name_male ()) print ( fake . name_female ()) print ( fake . prefix_male ()) print ( fake . prefix ()) print ( fake . name ()) print ( fake . suffix_female ()) print ( fake . name_male ()) print ( fake . first_name ()) print ( fake . suffix_male ()) print ( fake . suffix ()) print ( fake . first_name_male ()) print ( fake . first_name_female ()) print ( fake . last_name_female ()) print ( fake . last_name ()) print ( fake . prefix_female ()) Output Morar Dr. Mckinley Halvorson Dr. Mrs. Kadeem Parker MD Mr. Elliott Padberg Elvira III IV Arley Mariam Turner Huel Ms. You can read various methods available in Faker Module in detail @ https://faker.readthedocs.io/en/master/# You can find the above code @ https://github.com/gowrishankarnath/FakerPythonExamples","tags":"Articles","url":"/generate-fake-data-programmatically-using-faker-with-python.html","loc":"/generate-fake-data-programmatically-using-faker-with-python.html"}]};
